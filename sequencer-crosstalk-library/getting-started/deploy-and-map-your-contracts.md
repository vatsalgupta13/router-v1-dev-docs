# 3âƒ£ Deploy and map your contracts

Deploy the final contracts on different chains you want to interact with while making sure that you use the correct addresses of the Sequencer Handler for different chains. Please find the hardhat tasks for deployment [here](https://github.com/router-protocol/router-crosstalk-sample/tree/sequencer-staking/tasks).&#x20;

For example: If you deploy your contracts on Polygon and Fantom, you need to map the contract on Polygon with the contract on Fantom and also the contract on Fantom with the contract on Polygon. Please find tasks for mapping [here](https://github.com/router-protocol/router-crosstalk-sample/blob/sequencer-staking/tasks/mapContracts.ts).
