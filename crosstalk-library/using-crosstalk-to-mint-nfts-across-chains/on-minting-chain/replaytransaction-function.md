# 8âƒ£ replayTransaction Function

This function is used to replay a transaction stuck on the bridge due to insufficient gas limit or gas price passed while executing the routerSend function on the source chain.

Create a **replayTransaction** function as specified below. This function is used to enable replay mechanism, that is to re-execute a transaction that could not be executed on the destination chain due to insufficient gasLimit or gasPrice provided in the **`mintCrossChain`** function.

```solidity
// The hash returned from mintCrossChain function should be used to replay a tx.
// These gas limit and gas price should be higher than one entered in the original tx.
function relpayTransaction(
    bytes32 hash,
    uint256 gasLimit,
    uint256 gasPrice
  ) external onlyOwner {
    replayTx(hash, gasLimit, gasPrice);
  }
```
